# Fast-Settings

Quick implementation of adding settings to your prototypes.

**How to use:**

Drag and drop the prefab in the prefabs folder, and you're set to go!

**Notes:**

There is no functionality when using the "controls" tab, but it's up to you how you want to set it up. All expanded functionality is up to the creator, this is just a template. Enjoy it!


**Credits:**

Credits go to SlimUI for the graphical assets, I do not own these, but what's different is my custom set-up for the SettingsManager.cs where it can be easily expanded.
